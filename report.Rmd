# Introduction
This report seeks to understand how CDE initiatives have affected testing scores across the state for the years 2009-2010, specifically on the CSAP math scores for 9th-grade students. This report seeks to answer the following questions:

* Was there improvement in math scores between 2009 and 2010?
  * If so, did improvements in math scores lead to a decline in reading and writing scores?
* Was there any association between a school's math passing rate and its passing rates on reading and writing?
  * How accurately can we predict a school's math passing rate from its passing rates on reading and writing?


# Data Aquisition and Analysis
## Aquisition and Cleaning
Data for CSAP scores in 2009-2010 was collected from the Colorado Information Marketplace.^[https://data.colorado.gov/K-12/CSAP-School-And-District-Summary-Results-2010/44v8-6fzj/about_data] In order to ensure that the data we have acquired is suitable for use in our analyses, we must first "clean" the data. Data is cleaned in order to ensure that: 

1. each row of data is a school with 31 or more students enrolled for the years 2009 and 2010,
2. each column of data is a valid data type (categorical or numerical), and
3. each row contains data only for one school, year (2009 or 2010), and subject (reading, writing, or math). This will make it so that there are six total observations for any given school. 

Cleaning the data this way allows us to later easily sort the data by school, year, or subject. It also ensures that each observation we are using is valid, i.e. it belongs to a school and is not an observation that represents district or state totals.
